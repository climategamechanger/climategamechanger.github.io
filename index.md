At the [University of Hawaii ISR Seminar Series on Climate Change Adaptation](http://uhero.hawaii.edu/145) on October 29, 2018,  Professor Maxine Burkett from the Richardson School of Law gave a talk on "Climate Change, Migration, and Conflict: Engaging Law and Positive Peace". During the question and answer session following the talk, Professor Burkett was asked, "What is one thing the University of Hawaii can do to help address climate change?" She answered without hesitation:  "Require every student at the University to take a class on climate change."

Of course, the bureaucratic obstacles to creating a new, required course for all University of Hawaii students are significant, but those obstacles do not prevent us from acknowledging the wisdom of that goal or beginning work on what such a course might look like.  This website and accompanying materials are intended to provide a sketch of one potential solution as a starting point for discussion.

One structure that might work is a 1 credit course, offered more or less completely online, that would consist of (say) 12 "modules" that would each take about 1 hour of time to complete.  Add in a single half-day "event" and you'd get to around 16 contact hours, which I'm guessing is worth about 1 credit hour according to University of Hawaii policies.

To beta-test the course, it could be offered to residents of Hawaii. Having a curriculum in place for which we have gathered positive evaluation data from a public offering would presumably make it much easier to establish such a course as required at UH.

In thinking about how to create a successful online course for Hawaii residents, a number of additional useful requirements emerged:

*Free*.  The course must be free. We will not get significant adoption or useful evaluation data if the course has a paywall.

*Mobile*. You should be able to successfully complete the course using only your smart phone. Requiring the user to be "tethered" to a laptop will also significantly reduce adoption. 

*Game mechanics*.  There is the potential to significantly increase engagement and effectiveness through very careful design and implementation of features that make the course into a [serious game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serious_game). An interesting example of a serious game is [World without Oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-hzUGFD-Gc).
