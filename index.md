At the [University of Hawaii ISR Seminar Series on Climate Change Adaptation](http://uhero.hawaii.edu/145) on October 29, 2018,  Professor Maxine Burkett from the Richardson School of Law gave a talk on "Climate Change, Migration, and Conflict: Engaging Law and Positive Peace". During the question and answer session following the talk, Professor Burkett was asked, "What is one thing the University of Hawaii can do to help address climate change?" She answered without hesitation:  "Require every student at the University to take a class on climate change."

Of course, the bureaucratic obstacles to creating a new, required course for all University of Hawaii students are significant, but those obstacles do not prevent us from acknowledging the wisdom of that goal or begin work on what such a course might look like.  
This website and accompanying materials provide a sketch of one potential solution.
